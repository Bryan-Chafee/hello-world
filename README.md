World of Other-kin
It was my first time playing World of Tanks online, I was so excited. I heard so many cool things about the epic battles and was eager to join in on it. I decided that going with a small and fast tank was more to my style, the AMX 13 90. I quickly joined a public match, its Westfield, a wonderfully lush area filled with forests fields and farm lands; I was at home. I spotted what looked to be a medium tank in the distance, I approached cautiously thinking I could take him out. As I get closer I realise that though the tank is intact, he had been defeated, I approached him to ask what could have done such a thing. He saw me and quickly set his engine into reverse. Obviously frightened I asked him “what’s wrong?”. He raised his optical periscope followed by his main gun, looked me in the eyes and told “RUN! “. Confused, I soon realise there was a M6A2E1 rolling up behind me, it was too late. Instead of showing mercy I was met with him rolling onto my hull, I thought “what’s going on?”. The next thing I knew his… Glacis plate was entering my engine air intake :’( . I let a squeamish honk loose, thrusting himself deeper. The M6A2E1 exclaimed, “I’ve always wanted to taste a young AMX 13 90, so small and frail. IT REALLY GETS ME ENGINES REVVING!”. I lower my Mantle in defeat. Oils and exhaust releasing from my rear, I had accepted the fate that had befell upon my young air intake.
